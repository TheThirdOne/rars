<h3>MARS - Mips Assembly and Runtime Simulator</h3>
<h4>Release 4.5</h4>
<h4>August 2014</h4>
<h4>Interactive Debugging Features</h4>
</center>

<p>
MARS provides many features for interactive debugging through its Execute pane.
Features include:
<ul>
<li>In <i>Step</i> mode, the next instruction to be simulated is highlighted and
memory content displays are updated at each step.</li>

<li>Select the <i>Go</i> option if you want to simulate continually.
It can also be used to continue simulation
from a paused (step, breakpoint, pause) state.</li>

<li>Breakpoints are easily set and reset using the check boxes next to each instruction displayed
in the Text Segment window.  <i>New in Release 3.8:</i> You can temporarily suspend breakpoints
using Toggle Breakpoints in the Run menu or by clicking the "Bkpt" column header in the Text Segment
window.  Repeat, to re-activate.</li>

<li>When running in the <i>Go</i> mode, you can select the simulation
speed using the Run Speed slider.  Available speeds range
from .05 instructions per second (20 seconds between steps) up to 30
instructions per second, then above this offers an "unlimited" speed.
When using "unlimited" speed, code highlighting and memory display updating 
are turned off while simulating (but it executes really fast!).  
When a breakpoint is reached, highlighting and updating occur.
Run speed can be adjusted while the program is running.</li>

<li>When running in the <i>Go</i> mode, you can pause or stop
simulation at any time using the <i>Pause</i> or <i>Stop</i> features.
The former will pause execution and update the display, as if you
were stepping or at a breakpoint.  The latter will terminate execution
and display final memory and register values.  If running at "unlimited"
speed, the system may not respond immediately but it will respond.</li>


<li>You have the ability to interactively step "backward" through program execution 
one instruction at a time to "undo" execution steps.  It will buffer up to 2000 of the most 
recent execution steps (this limit is stored in a properties file and can be changed).
It will undo changes made to MIPS memory, registers or condition flags,
but not console or file I/O.  This should be a great debugging aid.  
It is available anytime execution is paused and at termination (even if terminated due to 
exception).  

<li>When program execution is paused or terminated, select <i>Reset</i>
to reset all memory cells and registers to their initial post-assembly values.
In fact, Reset is implemented by re-assembling the program.</li>

<li>Memory addresses and values, and register values, can be viewed in either decimal
or hexadecimal format.  All data are stored in little-endian byte order (each 
word consists of byte 3 followed by byte 2 then 1 then 0).  Note that each word
can hold 4 characters of a string and those 4 characters will appear in the
reverse order from that of the string literal.</li>

<li>Data segment contents are displayed 512 bytes
at a time (with scrolling) starting with the data segment base address (0x10010000).  
Navigation buttons are provided to change the display to the next 
section of memory, the previous, or back to the initial (home) range.  A combo box is 
also provided to view memory contents in the vicinity of the stack pointer 
(contents of MIPS $sp register), global pointer (contents of MIPS $gp register),
the heap base address (0x10040000), .extern globals (0x10000000),
the kernel data segment (0x90000000), or memory-mapped IO (MMIO, 0xFFFF0000).
<em>Starting with Mars 4.4,</em> raw text segment contents can also be displayed.</li>

<li>Contents of any data segment memory word and almost any MIPS register can be modified by 
editing its displayed table cell.  Double-click on a cell to edit it and press the Enter key
when finished typing the new value.  If you
enter an invalid 32-bit integer, the word INVALID appears in the cell
and memory/register contents are not affected.  Values can be entered
in either decimal or hexadecimal (leading "0x").  Negative hexadecimal 
values can be entered in either two's complement or signed format.  Note
that three of the integer registers (zero, program counter, return address) 
cannot be edited.</li>

<li><em>New in 4.4</em> If the setting for Self-Modifying Code is enabled
(disabled by default, look in the Settings menu), text segment binary
code can be modified using the same technique described above. It can also
be modified by double-clicking on a cell in the Text Segment display's Code
column.</li>

<li>Contents of cells representing floating point registers can be edited 
as described above and will accept valid hexadecimal or decimal floating point
values.  Since each double-precision register overlays two single-precision 
registers, any changes to a double-precision register will affect one or both
of the displayed contents of its corresponding single-precision registers.
Changes to a single-precision register will affect the display of its
corresponding double-precision register.  Values entered in hexadecimal 
need to conform to IEEE-754 format.  Values entered in decimal are entered
using decimal points and E-notation (e.g. 12.5e3 is 12.5 times 10 cubed).</li>

<li>Cell contents can be edited during program execution and once accepted
will apply starting with the next instruction to be executed.</li>

<li>Clicking on a Labels window entry will cause the location associated with 
that label to be centered and highlighted in the Text Segment or Data Segment
window as appropriate.  Note the Labels window is not displayed by default but
can be by selecting it from the Settings menu.</li>

</ul>
