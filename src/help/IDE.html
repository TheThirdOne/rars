<h3>RARS - RISC-V Assembler and Runtime Simulator</h3>
<h4>Release 1.0</h4>
<h4>August 2017</h4>
<h4>Using RARS through its Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</h4>
</center>

The IDE is invoked when RARS is run with no command arguments, e.g. <tt>java -jar rars.jar</tt>.
It may also be launched from a graphical interface by double-clicking the <tt>rars.jar</tt> icon
that represents this executable JAR file.
The IDE provides basic editing, assembling and execution capabilities.  Hopefully it
is intuitive to use.  Here are comments on some features.
<ul>
<li><b>Menus and Toolbar</b>: Most menu items have equivalent toolbar icons.
If the function of a toolbar icon is not obvious, just hover the mouse over it and
a tool tip will soon appear.  Nearly all menu items also have keyboard shortcuts.
Any menu item not appropriate in a given situation is disabled.</li>
<li>
    <b>Editor</b>: RARS includes two integrated text editors.  The default editor features syntax-aware color
    highlighting of most language elements and popup instruction guides.  The original, generic, text
    editor without these features is still available and can be selected in the Editor Settings dialog.
    It supports a single font which can be modified in the Editor Settings dialog.
    The bottom border of either editor includes the cursor line
    and column position and there is a checkbox to display line numbers.
    They are displayed outside the editing area.  If you use an external editor, RARS provides
    a convenience setting that will automatically assemble a file as soon as it is opened.  See
    the Settings menu.
<li><b>Message Areas</b>: There are two tabbed message areas at the
bottom of the screen.  The <i>Run I/O</i> tab is used at runtime for 
displaying console output and entering console input as program execution progresses.  
You have the option of entering console input into a pop-up dialog then echoes to the message area.  
The <i>RARS Messages</i> tab is used for other messages such as assembly or
runtime errors and informational messages.  You can click on assembly error messages to
select the corresponding line of code in the editor.
<li><b>Registers</b>: Registers are displayed at all times, even
when you are editing and not running a program.  While writing your program,
this serves as a useful reference for register names and their conventional
uses (hover mouse over the register name to see tool tips).  There are three
register tabs: the Register File (integer registers $0 through $31 plus LO,
HI and the Program Counter), selected Coprocesor 0 registers (exceptions and
interrupts), and Coprocessor 1 floating point registers.

<li><b>Assembly</b>: Select <i>Assemble</i> from the <i>Run</i> menu or the
corresponding toolbar icon to assemble the file currently in the Edit tab.
files in current directory.</i>  With the Assemble All setting turned on the assembler will assemble
the current file as the "main" program and also assemble all other assembly
files (*.asm; *.s) in the same directory. And with the Assemble Open option, currently
open the assembler will also assemble currently open files. The results are linked and if all these
operations were successful the program can be executed.  Labels that are
declared global with the ".globl" directive may be referenced in any of the
other files in the project.  There is also a setting that permits
automatic loading and assembly of a selected exception handler file.


<li><b>Execution</b>: Once a program successfully assembles, the
registers are initialized and three windows
in the Execute tab are filled: <i>Text Segment</i>, <i>Data Segment</i>,
and <i>Program Labels</i>.  The major execution-time features are described below.

<li><b>Labels Window</b>: Display of the Labels window (symbol table) is
controlled through the Settings menu.  When displayed, you can click on any label
or its associated address to center and highlight the contents of that address 
in the Text Segment window or Data Segment window as appropriate.
</ul>

<p>The assembler and simulator are invoked from the IDE
when you select the <i>Assemble</i>, <i>Go</i>,
or <i>Step</i> operations from the <i>Run</i> menu or their corresponding
toolbar icons or keyboard shortcuts.  RARS messages are displayed on the
<i>RARS Messages</i> tab of the message area at the bottom of the screen.
Runtime console input and output is handled in the <i>Run I/O</i> tab.
