/**
 * Represents a single entry of the Branch History Table.
 * <p>
 * The entry holds the information about former branch predictions and outcomes.
 * The number of past branch outcomes can be configured and is called the history.
 * The semantics of the history of size <i>n</i> is as follows.
 * The entry will change its prediction, if it mispredicts the branch <i>n</i> times in series.
 * The prediction of the entry can be obtained by the {@link BHTEntry#getPrediction()} method.
 * Feedback of taken or not taken branches is provided to the entry via the {@link BHTEntry#updatePrediction(boolean)} method.
 * This causes the history and the prediction to be updated.
 * <p>
 * Additionally the entry keeps track about how many times the prediction was correct or incorrect.
 * The statistics can be obtained by the methods {@link BHTEntry#getStatsPredCorrect()}, {@link BHTEntry#getStatsPredIncorrect()} and {@link BHTEntry#getStatsPredPrecision()}.
