    // is written to an address within it.  Thus most small programs will use only 8K bytes

    // the start of the 65'th block -- table entry 64.  That leaves (1024-64) * 4096 = 3,932,160

    // The other major difference is the stack grows DOWNWARD from its base address, not
    // upward.  I.e., the stack base is the largest stack address. This turns the whole 
    // scheme for translating memory address to block-offset on its head!  The simplest
    // solution is to calculate relative address (offset from base) by subtracting the 
    // desired address from the stack base address (rather than subtracting base address
