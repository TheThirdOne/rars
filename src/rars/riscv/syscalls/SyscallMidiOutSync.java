to use a specific method for synchronously generating
a tone, rather than using an asyncronous method followed
by a Thread.sleep, because sleeping isn't a reliable
synchronization method -- depending on thread scheduling,
the actual tone generation could have been delayed, in
which case the tone might still be playing when the
sleep ended.
