     *  Dynamically loads MarsTools into an ArrayList.  This method is adapted from

     *
     *  Bug Fix 25 Feb 06, DPS: method did not recognize tools folder if its
     *  absolute pathname contained one or more spaces (e.g. C:\Program Files\rars\tools).
     *  Problem was, class loader's getResource method returns a URL, in which spaces
     *  are replaced with "%20".  So I added a replaceAll() to change them back.
     *
     *  Enhanced 3 Oct 06, DPS: method did not work if running MARS from a JAR file.
     *  The array of files returned is null, but the File object contains the name
     *  of the JAR file (using toString, not getName).  Extract that name, open it
     *  as a ZipFile, get the ZipEntry enumeration, find the class files in the tools
     *  folder, then continue as before.
