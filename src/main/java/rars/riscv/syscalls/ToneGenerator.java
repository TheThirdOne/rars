/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

//
//  The ToneGenerator and Tone classes were developed by Otterbein College
//  student Tony Brock in July 2007.  They simulate MIDI output through the
//  computers soundcard using classes and methods of the javax.sound.midi
//  package.
//
//  Max Hailperin <max@gustavus.edu> changed the interface of the
//  ToneGenerator class 2009-10-19 in order to
//  (1) provide a reliable way to wait for the completion of a
//       synchronous tone,
//  and while he was at it,
//  (2) improve the efficiency of asynchronous tones by using a thread
//      pool executor, and
//  (3) simplify the interface by removing all the unused versions
//       that provided default values for various parameters

	* for synchronization, a role it cannot reliably serve.  In
