            // A couple statements below were added for the purpose of assuring that when
            // "back stepping" is enabled, every instruction will have at least one entry
            // on the back-stepping stack.  Most instructions will because they write either
            // to a register or memory.  But "nop" and branches not taken do not.  When the
            // user is stepping backward through the program, the stack is popped and if
            // an instruction has no entry it will be skipped over in the process.  This has
            // no effect on the correctness of the mechanism but the visual jerkiness when
            // instruction highlighting skips such instrutions is disruptive.  Current solution
            // is to add a "do nothing" stack entry for instructions that do no write anything.
            // To keep this invisible to the "simulate()" method writer, we
            // will push such an entry onto the stack here if there is none for this instruction
            // by the time it has completed simulating.  This is done by the IF statement
            // just after the call to the simulate method itself.  The BackStepper method does
            // the aforementioned check and decides whether to push or not.  The result
            // is a a smoother interaction experience.  But it comes at the cost of slowing
            // simulation speed for flat-out runs, for every MIPS instruction executed even
            // though very few will require the "do nothing" stack entry.  For stepped or
            // timed execution the slower execution speed is not noticeable.
            //
            // To avoid this cost I tried a different technique: back-fill with "do nothings"
            // during the backstepping itself when this situation is recognized.  Problem
            // was in recognizing all possible situations in which the stack contained such
            // a "gap".  It became a morass of special cases and it seemed every weird test
            // case revealed another one.  In addition, when a program
            // begins with one or more such instructions ("nop" and branches not taken),
            // the backstep button is not enabled until a "real" instruction is executed.
